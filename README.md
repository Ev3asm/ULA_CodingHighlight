Hello, I'm Andrew Magner, a mechanical engineer and computer science double major student from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

Due to ITAR restrictions and confidentiality requirements associated with my work in high-power rocketry and aerospace projects, I am limited to sharing 
code that originates from my advanced coursework, independent technical exercises, and sanitized recreations of real-world engineering problems.

I have organized the repository by language used, aiming to give multiple examples of me coding in a specific language. Not shared here is my recent work
with Python and C++, which I have been using for the past seven months as the languages of choice regarding my aerospace guidance and control projects. 
Due to aiming to highlight the range of languages I am experienced with, I was unable to upload all of the supporting files for each project presented. 
Some files may fail to run or do so incorrectly because of this, but I hope that an analysis of the actual work presented will show my experience and 
problem-solving skillset.
